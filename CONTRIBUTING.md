# Contributing

If you want to contribute to the Kotlin language specificaion, welcome!
This document describes the ways one could help with the specification together with the most important contribution guidelines.

## How to contribute?

You have several options on how to contribute.

1. Create an [issue](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-spec/issues)
1. Make a [pull request](https://github.com/Kotlin/kotlin-spec/pulls)
1. Drop an email to [Marat Akhin](mailto:marat.akhin@jetbrains.com) or [Mikhail Belyaev](mailto:mikhail.belyaev@jetbrains.com)

In any of these cases, if we are talking about semantic changes to the specification, please try to include not only the improvements themselves, but also the reasoning on why you believe such a change is needed.

> If we are talking about simple, but still very much appreciated improvements, e.g., fixing grammar, spelling or punctuation mistakes, no justification is required for those.

If you are contributing information specific to a particular Kotlin version or an known experimental feature, be sure to mention them in the changes.
