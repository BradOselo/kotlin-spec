## Type inference

Kotlin has a concept of *type inference* for compile-time type information, meaning some type information in the code may be omitted, to be inferred by the compiler. There are two kinds of type inference supported by Kotlin.

- Local type inference, for inferring types of expressions locally, in statement/expression scope;
- Function signature type inference, for inferring types of function return values and/or parameters.

> Note: type inference is a [type constraint][Kotlin type constraints] problem, and is usually solved by a type constraint solver.

### Smart casts

Kotlin introduces a limited form of flow-dependent typing called *smart casting*.
Flow-dependent typing means some expressions in the program may introduce changes to the compile-time types of variables.
This allows one to avoid unneeded explicit casting of values in cases where their runtime types are guaranteed to conform to the expected compile-time types.

Smart casts are dependent on two main things: *smart cast sources* and *value stability*.

#### Smart cast sources

There are two kinds of smart cast sources: *nullability conditions* and *type conditions*.
Nullability conditions specify that some value is not nullable, i.e., its value is guaranteed to not be `null`.
Type conditions specify that some value's runtime type conforms to a constraint $RT <: T$, where $T$ is the assumed type and $RT$ is the runtime type.

> Note: nullability conditions may be viewed as a special case of type conditions with assumed type `kotlin.Any`.

These sources influence the compile-time type of a value in some expression (called *smart cast sink*) only if the value is [*stable*][Value stability] and if the source [dominates][Source-sink domination] the sink.
The actual compile-time type of a smart casted value for any purpose (including, but not limited to, function overloading and type inference of other values) is as follows.

- If the smart cast source is a nullability condition, the type is the [intersection][Type intersection] of the type it had before (including the results of smart casting performed for other conditions) and type `kotlin.Any` TODO(Does it actually work like that, or nullability is still somewhat funky?);
- If the smart cast source is a type condition, the type is the [intersection][Type intersection] of the type it had before (including the results of smart casting performed for other conditions) and the assumed type of the condition.

Smart cast sources are introduced by:

- Conditional expressions (`if` and `when`);
- Elvis operator (operator `?:`);
- Safe navigation operator (operator `?.`);
- Logical conjunction expressions (operator `&&`);
- Logical disjunction expressions (operator `||`);
- Not-null assertion expressions (operator `!!`);
- Direct casting expression (operator `as`);
- Direct assignments;
- Platform-specific cases: different platforms may add other kinds of expressions which introduce additional smart cast sources.

> Note: property declarations are not listed here, as their types are derived from initializers.

Nullability and type conditions are derived in the following way.

- $x$` is `$T$ where $x$ is an applicable expression implies a type condition for $x$ with assumed type $T$;
- $x$` !is `$T$ where $x$ is an applicable expression implies a negated type condition for $x$ with assumed type $T$;
- $x$` != null` or `null != `$x$ where $x$ is an applicable expression implies a nullability condition for $x$;
- $x$` == null` or `null == `$x$ where $x$ is an applicable expression implies a negated nullability condition for $x$;
- `!`$x$ implies all the conditions implied by $x$, but in negated form;
- $x$` && `$y$ implies all the non-negated conditions implied by $x$ and $y$ and the intersection of all the negated conditions implied by $x$ and $y$;
- $x$` || `$y$ implies all the negated conditions implied by $x$ and $y$ and the intersection of all the non-negated conditions implied by $x$ and $y$;
- $x$` === `$y$ or $y$` === `$x$ where $x$ is an applicable expression and $y$ is a known non-nullable value (that is, has a non-nullable compile-time type) implies the nullability condition for $x$;
- $x$` == `$y$ or $y$` == `$x$ where $x$ is an applicable expression and $y$ is a known non-nullable value (that is, has a non-nullable compile-time type) implies the nullability condition for $x$, but only if the corresponding [`equals` implementation][Value equality expressions] is known to be equivalent to [reference equality check][Reference equality expressions].
    + TODO(examples of when this equivalence is true)

Additionally, any type condition with assumed *non-null* type also creates a nullability condition for its value.
This is used in [bound smart casts][Bound smart casts].

#### Value stability

TODO(Everything...)

A value is *stable* for smart casting if its value cannot be changed from the smart cast source to the smart cast sink; this guarantees the smart cast conditions still hold at the sink.
Value stability breaks in the presence of the following aspects.

* concurrent writes
* separate module compilation
* custom getters
* delegation

Also, value stability is *very* complicated for local variables.

The following values are considered stable w.r.t. smart casts.

- Immutable local or classifier-scope properties without delegation or custom getters;
- Immutable properties of stable properties without delegation or custom getters;
- Mutable local properties without delegation or custom getters, if the compiler can prove that they are effectively immutable, i.e., cannot be changed by external means from the smart cast source to the smart cast sink.
    - > Example: any properties which are captured in non-inlining lambda expressions or anonymous objects are not effectively immutable after their capture.

#### Source-sink domination

A smart cast source $SO$ dominates a smart cast sink $SI$, if $SO$ is a control-flow dominator of $SI$.
This means the following for different smart cast sources.

- Conditional expressions (`if` and `when`):
    - Smart cast conditions derived from expression condition are active inside the true branch scope;
    - Smart cast conditions derived from negated expression condition are active inside the false branch scope;
    - If a branch is statically known to be definitely evaluated, that branch's condition is also propagated over to the containing scope after the conditional expression;
- Elvis operator (operator `?:`): if the right-hand side of elvis operator is unreachable, a nullability condition for the left-hand side expression (if applicable) is introduced for the rest of the containing scope;
- Safe navigation operator (operator `?.`) TODO()
- Logical conjunction expressions (operator `&&`): all conditions derived from the left-hand expression are applied to the right-hand expression;
- Logical disjunction expressions (operator `||`): all condtions derived from the left-hand expression are applied *negated* to the right-hand expression;
- Not-null assertion expressions (operator `!!`): a nullability condition for the left-hand side expression (if applicable) is introduced for the rest of the containing scope;
- Unsafe cast expression (operator `as`): a type condition for the left-hand side expression (if applicable) is introduced for the rest of the containing scope; the assumed type is the same as the right-hand side type of the cast expression;
- Direct assignment: if both sides of the assignment are applicable expressions, all the conditions currently applying to the right-hand side are also applied to the left-hand side of the assignment for the rest of the containing scope.

Source-sink domination rules also mean that smart cast sources from the loop bodies and conditions are **not** propagated to the upper scope, as the loop body may be evaluated zero or more times, and the corresponding condition may or may not be true.
However, some loop configurations, for which we can have static guarantees about source-sink domination, are handled differently.

* do-while loops (as their body is evaluated at least once) propagate the following to the rest of the containing scope:
    * smart cast sources from the loop body, which definitely dominate their sinks (TODO(example with break/continue))
    * smart cast conditions arising from the *negated* loop condition, if the loop body does not contain any `break` expressions
* `while (true)` loops propagate the following to the rest of the containing scope:
    * smart cast sources from the loop body, which definitely dominate their sinks (TODO(example with break/continue))

> Note: in the second case, only the exact `while (true)` form is handled as described; e.g., `while (true == true)` does not work.

> Note: one may extend the number of loop configurations, which are handled by smart casting, if the implementation can statically guarantee the source-sink domination.

#### Bound smart casts

Smart casting propagates information forward on the control flow, as by the source-sink domination.
However, in some cases it is beneficial to propagate information *backwards*, to reduce boilerplate code.
Kotlin supports this feature by bound smart casts.

Bound smart casts apply in the following case.
Assume we have two inter-dependent or bound values $a$ and $b$.
Bound smart casts allow to apply smart cast sources for $a$ to $b$ or vice versa, if both values are stable.

Kotlin supports the following bound smart casts (BSC).

- Nullability-by-equality BSC. If two values are known to be equal, nullability conditions for one are applied to the other.
- Nullability-by-safe-call BSC. For a safe-call property `o?.p` of a non-null type $T$, nullability conditions for `o?.p` are applied to `o`.

Two values $a$ and $b$ are considered equals in the following cases.

- there is a known equality or referential-equality condition between $a$ and $b$
- $a$ is definitely assigned $b$
    + however, in this case bound smart casts are applied only to $b$
    + TODO(Why?)

TODO(Do we need additional condition kinds?)

### Local type inference

Local type inference in Kotlin is the process of deducing the compile-time types of expressions, lambda expression parameters and properties.
As mentioned above, type inference is a [type constraint][Kotlin type constraints] problem, and is usually solved by a type constraint solver.

In addition to the types of intermediate expressions, local type inference also performs deduction and substitution for generic type parameters of functions and types involved in every expression.
You can use the [Expressions][Expressions] part of this specification as a reference point on how the types for different expressions are constructed.

However, there are some additional clarifications on how these types are constructed.
First, the additional effects of [smart casting][Smart casts] are considered in local type inference, if applicable.
Second, there are several special cases.

- If a type $T$ is described as the least upper bound of types $A$ and $B$, it is represented as a pair of constraints $A <: T$ and $B <: T$;
- TODO(are there other cases?)

Type inference in Kotlin is bidirectional; meaning the types of expressions may be derived not only from their arguments, but from their usage as well.
Note that, albeit bidirectional, this process is still local, meaning it processes one statement at a time, strictly in the order of their appearance in a scope; e.g., the type of property in statement $S_1$ that goes before statement $S_2$ cannot be inferred based on how $S_1$ is used in $S_2$.

As solving a type constraint system is not a definite process (there may be more than one valid solution for a given [constraint system][Type constraint solving]), type inference in general may have several valid solutions.
In particular, one may always derive a system $A <: T <: B$ for every type variable $T$, where $A$ and $B$ are both valid solution types.
One of these types is always the solution in Kotlin (although from the constraint viewpoint, there are usually more solutions available), but choosing between them is done according to the following rules:

- TODO(what are the rules?)

> Note: this is valid even if $T$ is a variable without any explicit constraints, as every type in Kotlin has an implicit constraint $\mathtt{kotlin.Nothing} <: T <: \mathtt{kotlin.Any?}$.

### TODO

- Type approximation for public usage
- Ordering of lambdas (and ordering of overloading vs type inference in general)
