# Specification roadmap

## Short-term plans

* Improve Kotlin code examples
* Synchronize specification of complex features with their up-to-latest-date implementation
	* Bound smart casts
	* Operator expansions for non-trivial cases (aka operator desugaring)
	* Fallthrough-like overload resolution (`provideDelegate` + `getValue`, `plusAssign` + `plus` with assignment, etc.)

## Long-term plans

* Describe Kotlin Multiplatform Project (MPP) support
* Implement platform-specific parts of Kotlin language specification
	* Kotlin/JVM
	* Kotlin/JS
	* Kotlin/Native
