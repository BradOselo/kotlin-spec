<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Kotlin took inspiration from many programming languages, including (but not limited to) Java, C#, Groovy and TypeScript. </span><span class="sentence">One of the main ideas behind Kotlin is being <em>pragmatic</em>, i.e., being a programming language useful for day-to-day development, which helps the users get the job done via its features and its tools. </span><span class="sentence">Thus, a lot of design decisions were and still are influenced by how beneficial these decisions are for Kotlin users.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Kotlin is a multiplatform, statically typed, general-purpose programming language. </span><span class="sentence">Currently, as of version 1.4, it supports compilation to the following platforms.</span></p>
</div>
<ul>
<li><span class="sentence">JVM (Java Virtual Machine)</span></li>
<li><span class="sentence">JS (JavaScript)</span></li>
<li><span class="sentence">Native (native binaries)</span></li>
</ul>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Furthermore, it supports transparent interoperability between different platforms via its Kotlin Multiplatform Project (Kotlin MPP)feature.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">The type system of Kotlin distinguishes at compile time between nullable and not-nullable types, achieving null type safety, i.e., guaranteeing the absent of runtime errors caused by the absence of value (i.e., <code>null</code> value). </span><span class="sentence">Kotlin also extends its static type system with elements of gradual and flow typing, for better interoperability with other languages and ease of development.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Kotlin is an object-oriented language which also has a lot of functional programming elements. </span><span class="sentence">From the object-oriented side, it supports nominal subtyping with bounded parametric polymorphism (akin to generics) and mixed-site variance. </span><span class="sentence">From the functional programming side, it has first-class support for higher-order functions and lambda literals.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">This specification covers Kotlin/Core, i.e., fundamental parts of Kotlin which should function <em>mostly</em> the same way irregardless of the underlying plarform. </span><span class="sentence">These parts include such important things as language <a href="control--and-data-flow-analysis.html#expressions-1">expressions</a>, <a href="control--and-data-flow-analysis.html#declarations-1">declarations</a>, <a href="type-system.html#type-system">type system</a> and <a href="overload-resolution.html#overload-resolution">overload resolution</a>.</span></p>
</div>
<blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Important: due to the complexities of platform-specific implementations, platforms may extend, reduce or change the way some aspects of Kotlin/Core function. </span><span class="sentence">We mark these platform-dependent Kotlin/Core fragments in the specification to the best of our abilities.</span></p>
</div>
</blockquote>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Platform-specific parts of Kotlin and its multiplatform capabilities will be covered in their respective sub-specifications, i.e., Kotlin/JVM, Kotlin/JS and Kotlin/Native.</span></p>
