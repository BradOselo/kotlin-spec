<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Any entity declared in a declaration scope has an implicitly or explicitly defined <em>visibility</em>. </span><span class="sentence">The visibility of a declaration denotes whether the entity is <em>accessible</em> in other scopes of the program. </span><span class="sentence">If the entity declared in scope <code>A</code> is not accessible in scope <code>B</code>, it cannot be referred to in that scope, making such reference a compiler error. </span><span class="sentence">There are four basic types of visibility in kotlin: <code>public</code>, <code>private</code>, <code>internal</code> and <code>protected</code>, denoted by the corresponding visibility modifier keywords.</span></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><span class="sentence">Entities that have <code>public</code> visibility are generally accessible anywhere outside or inside the scope they are declared in, by using imports or qualification when necessary. </span><span class="sentence">Entities that have <code>private</code> visibility are only accessible inside the scope they are declared in or any nested scopes. </span><span class="sentence">For top-level scopes (i.e. kotlin files) it means that such entities are only accessible in the same file. </span><span class="sentence">Entities with <code>internal</code> visibility are accessible inside the same <a href="packages-and-imports.html#modules">module</a> just like if the visibility was <code>public</code> and are inaccessible (as if the visibility was <code>private</code>) in any other scope. </span><span class="sentence">Entities with <code>protected</code> visibility are only allowed in the body scope of class declarations and are used as a means of encapsulation: such entities are accessible inside any scope as if the visibility was <code>private</code>, but are also accessible by any derived classes’ scopes as if they were declared <code>private</code> in the body scope of the derived class.</span></p>
